# Become a Wizard

*This is the user manual to Compy*

## Introduction

Welcome to **Compy**, a programmable general-purpose computer for 
introducing children between the ages of 5 and 105 to the centuries-old 
tradition of **_wizardry_**. One could also say "*regular symbolic 
manipulations under a Turing-complete set of rules*" instead of 
"wizardry" and that would be certainly correct, but the latter seems a 
more fitting expression for the art of *creating* functioning mechanisms 
of unlimited complexity by merely describing them in a special language. 
Wizardry has been around for much longer than computers, so while 
*computer programming* is certainly wizardry, there is more to it than 
programming computers. A large part of mathematics and science is also 
wizardry and so is genetic engineering and many other important human 
endeavors. While capable wizards are today among the most sought-after 
specialists, mastering this art is its own reward, being one of the most 
stimulating intellectual exercises.

In this book, the first uses of important terms are set in **_bold 
italic_**. Usually, you will find the explanation of these terms somewhere 
around their first use. If not, you can look them up elsewhere or ask 
someone who knows what they mean. Framed texts are either **notes**, 
providing additional information typically relating the discussed topic 
to the broader context of the world beyond Compy or trivia, interesting 
facts related to the discussed topic, often providing a historical 
perspective or **challenges**. The first word in the frame, set in **bold 
regular** tells you which one that particular frame is. Texts that you 
should see on the screen, such as keywords, program line numbers, listings, 
reports and so on, are set in the native font of `Compy`.

## Meet the Console

After launching the **Compy IDE** app by double-clicking on the 
corresponsing icon on Compy's **_desktop_**, one faces Compy's 
**_console_**. The console is how wizards talk to computers, in their own 
language. Unlike the desktop, which is what muggles use to get the 
computer do what they need, the console allows you, in principle, to make 
the computer do *anything* that the computer is capable of doing at all. 
It might seem less fancy, but it is far more powerful and expressive than 
the desktop. Different computers might speak different languages on their 
console, but they are, in many ways, similar.

> **Note:** Truth be told, the console opened by this app is *not* the
> *actual* console of Compy, and unlike the latter, it *does* have certain
> limitations mainly to keep the user and the computer safe from each
> other. However, it is still enormously powerful, allowing everything
> one might need to develop video games and other fun and useful pieces of
> software.

The language your Compy understands is called **_Lua_**, which is Portuguese 
for "Moon". This is a word play, as it is a direct descendant of another 
computer language called Simple Object Language, or SOL for short, which, 
in turn, means "Sun" in Portuguese. The creators of Lua lived in Rio de 
Janeiro, Brazil and spoke Portuguese to one another. There are many 
versions of Lua; ours is called [Lua 5.1](https://www.lua.org/manual/5.1/), 
which is one of the most popular ones, especially in the video game industry.

When you turn on your Compy, after about a minute, it brings up the Android 
home screen as its desktop, which is probably familiar to you from countless 
interactions with tablets and smartphones with the Android operating system. 
Prominently on it, you find the **Compy IDE* icon, to which you can point 
using either Compy's touchpad or the mouse that comes with Compy. Unlike 
most Android devices, Compy's screen is *not* touch sensitive. After 
double-clicking the icon with the *left* button of the mouse or the 
touchpad, the entire screen except the very bottom turns into muted white.

You are using the console now, as indicated in the beginning of the 
**_status line_**, that black stripe with bright letters in it near the 
bottom of the screen. It is, essentially a dialog with the computer, 
similar to instant messaging. You type something, hit the **Enter** key and 
the computer responds. **Enter** is just about the most important key on 
the keyboard. Just pressing it means, "*Okay computer, I've typed in 
your orders. Now go and obey them.*"

As you start typing, you can immediately notice that the screen is divided 
into two parts by the status line. In fact, the part *below* it is the 
console, the part above it is the **_canvas_**. Inside the status line, you 
find the following information: `console` stands for the kind of input the 
console expects from you. In this case, it expects a sequence of 
**_statement_**s in Lua. Then you have `L1:1`, which just indicates that 
you are about to type the first letter of the first statement.

The bright vertical line is the so-called cursor which shows you where what 
you type is going to appear. If you have already typed in anything, you can 
move the cursor using the arrow keys. You can also delete what is *before* 
the cursor (which is normally what you have typed last) by hitting the 
**⟵** key int top right corner, just below a key marked **Delete**, which 
deletes what is *after* the cursor.

If you press **Caps Lock**, a green light at the bottom right marked with 
a padlock symbol with a capital A lights up (try!), meaning that you will 
by typing in CAPITAL LETTERS. You can change back to regular mode by 
pressing **Caps Lock** again. You can also type capital-case letters in 
regular mode by pressing and holding either of the **Shift** keys before 
hitting the letter key. The **Shift** key needs to be pressed while you are 
hitting the letter key in order for it to produce a capital letter. If you 
keep any key pressed long enough, it will repeat its function. To type the 
symbols above number or letter keys, you should also press one of the 
**Shift** keys similarly to how you type capital-case letters. In general, 
if there are two symbols above one another on a key, the bottom one is 
typed *without* the **Shift** key, while the top one is typed *with* it.

Now you know enough to start chatting with Compy.
