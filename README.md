# Become a Wizard

*This is the user manual to Compy*

## Introduction

Welcome to **Compy**, a programmable general-purpose computer for 
introducing children between the ages of 5 and 105 to the centuries-old 
tradition of **_wizardry_**. One could also say "*regular symbolic 
manipulations under a Turing-complete set of rules*" instead of 
"wizardry" and that would be certainly correct, but the latter seems a 
more fitting expression for the art of *creating* functioning mechanisms 
of unlimited complexity by merely describing them in a special language. 
Wizardry has been around for much longer than computers, so while 
*computer programming* is certainly wizardry, there is more to it than 
programming computers. A large part of mathematics and science is also 
wizardry and so is genetic engineering and many other important human 
endeavors. While capable wizards are today among the most sought-after 
specialists, mastering this art is its own reward, being one of the most 
stimulating intellectual exercises.

In this book, the first uses of important terms are set in **_bold 
italic_**. Usually, you will find the explanation of these terms somewhere 
around their first use. If not, you can look them up elsewhere or ask 
someone who knows what they mean. Framed texts are either **notes**, 
providing additional information typically relating the discussed topic 
to the broader context of the world beyond Compy or trivia, interesting 
facts related to the discussed topic, often providing a historical 
perspective or **challenges**. The first word in the frame, set in **bold 
regular** tells you which one that particular frame is. Texts that you 
should see on the screen, such as keywords, program line numbers, listings, 
reports and so on, are set in the native font of `Compy`.
